# multimodal
GitHub area for code and other stuff relating to the Multimodal magazines theme

## structure

*  `utilscripts/` includes random utility scripts (scraping text, image, etc). Mostly quite hackish bash; no ui/flags/fancy stuff
*  `imageanalysis/` tools for analyzing images (python scripts)
*  `textanalysis/` ditto for scraped text
